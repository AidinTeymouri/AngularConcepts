  pipes works!
</p>

<input type="number" [(ngModel)] = "val" placeholder="Enter the Number to be Squared">
<p>Squared Number is  {{val | square}} </p>

<hr>
Sending Values to Pipes adding two to the resultant square
<p>Squared Number plus 2 is {{val | square:2}} </p>



<!--Passing Multiple Arguments is also possible in  Pipe through array like
<p>Squared Number plus 2 is {{val | square:[2,2]}} </p>
transform(value: number, args?: number[]): number {
OR
<p>Squared Number plus 2 is {{val | square:2,2}} </p>
transform(value: number, args?: number,args2?:number[]): number {

Also help in traversing through nested objects in Ngfor please check my repo football details for such pipes
